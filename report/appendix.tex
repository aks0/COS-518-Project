\label{sec:appendix}
For the TPC-H benchmark query generator \texttt{qgen} to generate the queries, we had to fix a minor bug in \texttt{appendix/dbgen/config.h}. Line \texttt{65} in that file specifies an incorrect format specifier (for C) in the generation of \texttt{long long} numbers i.e.,\\
\centerline{\texttt{$\#$define HUGE\_FORMAT ``\%LLd''}}\\
\noindent should change to\\
\centerline{\texttt{$\#$define HUGE\_FORMAT ``\%lld''}}
