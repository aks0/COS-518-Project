\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented an adaptive approach to data placement in NewSQL systems, given a data model and a query workload. With a choice of how to colocate data that use partitioning and replication, we describe a method that adapts to workloads to minimize the number of distributed joins involved. Though our analysis can be generalized, we implemented our method specifically for SQLFire. We compared our adaptive approach with two other viable data placement strategies and showed that our strategy was better able to adjust to various query workloads.
